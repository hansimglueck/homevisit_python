Ask who wants to read the myth of Europe to all the others. (if nobody wants, offer some of your peanuts.)
Here it comes: Europe was the daughter of the Phoenician king Argos.
One afternoon, Europe played at the shore of the Mediterranean Sea with her friends, picking flowers and singing songs.
Suddenly a big bull approached the girls. The bull was actually the god Zeus, who had fallen in love with Europe and who had transformed himself into a bull to approach the girl.
The bull was all white and very beautiful.
Europe's friends became frightened of the animal and recoiled, but Europe felt no fear.
She approached the bull, started caressing him and decorated his horns with the flowers she and her friends had gathered before.
She said to her friends: "There is no need to be frightened. Look how beautiful and how gentle this bull is!" And she climbed the back of the animal.
When Zeus had achieved his goal, he ran to the shore with the girl on his back, entered the sea and started swimming. Now Europe got frightened indeed.
In vain she called for her friends, who could not help her. She pulled her feet and her dress up so she did not get wet, while the bull kept on swimming.
He swam for the rest of the day, and he swam the whole night through and also the following day. Finally, at the end of the second day, they arrived at a foreign shore.
It was Crete. When the bull had gone ashore, he let Europe climb off his back and then disappeared.
When Europe awoke the next morning after a long sleep, she was desperate. She called for her father, scolding herself for having been so high-spirited and careless to climp the back of the bull.
She cried: "If I met this accursed bull now, in this very minute, I would chase it away!" While she was agonizing this way, she heard a low whisper and a faint laughter behind her back.
It was the goddess Aphrodite. She said: "Calm yourself. Do you not know that the bull was not a real bull, but Zeus? You will be the wife of an immortal God, and your name will become immortal, too.
The country, which you set your foot on yesterday, will cary your name from now on. It will be called Europe after you."
And Europe married Zeus and they had many children together. And the continent she had set foot on was called Europe.
